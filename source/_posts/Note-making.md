### Note-making: a fundamental academic activity
Note-making is right at the heart of academic study. As a student, you will make notes when you:
* attend lectures or seminars
* read to support your writing of essays, reports, dissertations, and theses
Note-making is fundamental to these activities.

### Note-making: a significant challenge!
There are many situations, however, in which note-making can be a real challenge, for example if:
* the content of the lecture is predominantly factual and you want to try to record all of the facts but the lecturer is going
through it really quickly
* you make notes from masses of background reading, but are then stuck with how to use it all
* you make lots of notes for a piece of writing, but then worry about how to avoid accidentally plagiarising, as you can’t
remember which ideas were your own and which were from existing sources
* you find reading academic papers and books quite slow, and feel that you miss out on the overall sense of an article
because you spend too much time writing detailed notes as you read through it

### Differences between note-making in lectures and when reading
You may have a set of lecture slides in front of you, but you will still need to make your own notes in lectures. Extra slides
may be added; and the lecturer will invariably offer more explanation and examples than appear on the slides. You will also
want to record any ideas or queries of your own that you have during the lecture.

The big difference between note-making in lectures and note-making from reading is the lack of control that the student has
over the process, because lectures happen in real time. This means that:

…when note-making in lectures: |…but while note-making from reading:
-------------------------------|--------------------------------------
you can’t pause the lecturer; rewind; then replay; to go over something you haven’t understood | you can easily stop and read something again if you need to
if you are reminded of some information you want to look up, you have to make a note and remember to follow it up later |if you are reminded of some information you want to look up, you may be able to do it straightaway
you can’t slow down the lecturer if you fall behind with |you can read and make notes at the best pace for you, to make sure your notes are complete

A good way of appreciating the importance of good note-making is to spend five minutes trying to answer the following
question:

`If you tried to write an assignment or dissertation without doing any background reading and associated notemaking, what might it be missing?`

Try to build up a list of at least ten elements that could be missing from your writing if you did no background reading and
note-making at all! Some suggested answers are given on page 7 of this Study Guide.

### Note-making from reading
### Risk-taking
You cannot avoid taking risks when you take notes! The risks tend to relate to note-making that is too detailed, and to notemaking that is too brief. You need to decide where to place yourself along this continuum of risk.

#### Being too brief
To avoid making masses of notes that you may not actually use, you decide to write down the minimum
##### The risk
You fail to record crucial material, and have to go back to the source and read it again

#### Being too comprehensive
To make sure you don’t miss anything important,you decide to write down every piece of information that may possibly be relevant
##### The risk
Your reading takes far too long; you end up with masses of notes; you still can’t decide which are the most relevant; and you run out of time to do your writing


### Managing the risk by being selective
Being selective is the key to successful note-making. There are two main levels at which you need to be selective:
* deciding what to read and what not to read
* deciding which specific material to make notes on

### Deciding what to read and what not to read
Information that may help you decide is:
* the year of publication: how up to date is the information in relation to your specific topic?
* the contents page and index: are there specific sections devoted to your topic of interest?
* the abstract, introduction, or preface: they should help you to decide whether to read more
* beginnings and ends of promising sections: do they suggest that the content is worth reading in more detail?


### Deciding which specific material to make notes on
Some useful questions are posed by Stella Cottrell (2003):
* Do you really need this information? If so, which bits?
* Will you really use it? When, and how?
* Have you noted similar information already?
* What questions do you want to answer with this information?”

### Don’t be pushed along by the literature: approach it with a plan!
Take the analogy of visiting a supermarket to buy food for a party. If you simply wander in to see what there is, and buy anything that looks nice, you will probably end up back home wondering:
* why you bought far too many puddings and cakes
* how you will be able to make use of that huge quantity of fruit and vegetables, before they go bad
* why you bought masses of drinks of all kinds (although there are just 20 people coming), but you forgot to buy any extra coffee
* how much money you have just wasted on stuff you don’t need
* when you’ll be able to fit in another visit to the shops to buy the stuff you’ve forgotten
* how much better it would have been if you had started off with a list

Translating this image onto the academic practice of note-making, you will see that wandering into a text and simply writing down everything that looks interesting is neither an efficient nor an effective approach. A plan is needed.

This table gives some suggestions for how to begin your planning. It uses the idea of going food shopping for a party as an analogy for reading for an assignment.


### Note-making templates
Using a note-making template can help you to:
* make notes in a clear and readable format
* remember the kind of information you want to record from each source
* standardise your notes so you can find particular elements again more easily when you come to use them.

When you have decided that a source is going to be useful and you are going to make notes on it, you need to record the full referencing details. After that there are various headings under which you may want to make notes. Here are some ideas of the kinds of headings you might choose to use.

* main purpose of text
* suggested future research
* problem(s) encountered
* study population
* method(s) used
* useful case study
* useful example(s)
* main argument(s)
* useful material to quote
* idea(s) you can use
* supporting evidence for your argument
* particular relevance to my assignment
* limitation(s)
* main finding(s)
* geographical / political setting
* writing style + examples
* context
* theory
* useful statistics
* justification for the research

You can also devise your own template, using the kind of headings listed in the table above that are the most appropriate to
your own discipline and topic, so that:
* instead of wandering into the literature and feeling overwhelmed by it, you
* take control before you engage with the literature, and go in with your ‘shopping list’ already prepared


### Note-making in lectures
The particular challenges presented by trying to make notes in lectures are:
* you have no control over the speed at which the lecturer talks, so there may be some time pressure on your notemaking
* you cannot pause and go over some information again, like you can when you are reading
* you may not be able to identify until later, which elements of the lecture were the most important to make notes about

You can keep more control over the situation if you devise ways of streamlining your note-making practice.

A lot of the guidance on note-making in lectures seems to hold an idealistic view of what students can routinely manage to
attain. The following suggestions are from the usually realistic and helpful Stella Cottrell (2003 p138).

“Before the lecture:
* Get a feel for the subject. Read (or just flick through) a book on the subject of the lecture. Look for themes,
issues, topics and headings. Look up any technical words you don’t understand.
* Write down questions you want answered. Leave space to write the answers under each question either during
or after the lecture.
* Jot down your own opinion. Notice if it changes during the lecture.
* Glance through your notes for the previous lecture, and look for links with the next lecture.”

She also advises that, after the lecture, you:
* “Label and file your lecture notes and any handouts.
* Read through your notes. Fill in details from your reading or research.
